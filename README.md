# DirectoryChecker
 
This is a very small application that allows you to select various folders in a directory and display the size of their contents, sorting from largest to smallest.

I often found that right clicking to see folder properties was not an efficient way to see their size, nor did the File Size column in the File Explorer display the size of folders, only individuals files.
